# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


This is project0, focusing on my personal blog.
The blog consists of four pages, which are the Home, About, Portfolio and Contact pages.

The Home page contains the author's name and title with a picture of my work station, and provides a subscription field that allows visitors to subscribe with their name and email address although technically this option is not yet fully functional and needs to be updated.

The About page contains a small overview of my career debut in software development as well as my personal interests and a list of my skills learned so far.

The Portfolio page contains the screenshots of some of my projects, mainly in front end development, and links to my codepen profile to allow visitors to view more details online.

Lastly, the Contact page contains my full contacts information such as my address, cellphone numbers and e-mail. I also integrated an e-mail and textbox field to allow visitors to contact me through the blog although technically this option is also not yet fully functional and needs to be updated.

All four pages contain a navigation bar that consists of links to aid visitors in accessing all other pages within the blog, and a footer providing the links to all my social media accounts.

Technically, I created my web pages in HTML5, and subsequently used SASS/SCSS, then recompiled into a CSS file to style these pages and  make them mobile responsive. I also implemented Bootstrap in some pages to fulfill further requirements of this project. And eventually, my blog was built using Pythonâ€™s web framework Flask.
