			<h3>Hi, It's Me!</h3>
			<p>
				I started with <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x" target="_blank">cs50</a>, a Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of Computer Science and the art of programming through edx. This course was very challenging for me as an entry-level course without any programming experience but it was really important to start with, it gave  me a robust understanding of computer science and programming, taught me how to solve programming problems efficiently and how to present a final programming project. The languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML.
			</p>
			<p>
			<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x" target="_blank">Cs50</a> course has increased my desire to further develop my knowledge and skills in software development. After some research, I found <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> which I believe has the right Curriculum mapping and provides the right tools for full stack web development while I'm still enhancing my knowledge and skills of python, C and other languages with  other learning platforms.
